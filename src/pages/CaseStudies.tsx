              How Oceanus Generated 30% Of Revenue From Emails Using Retention-First Strategy
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              Oceanus The Label is a luxury swimwear and resort-wear brand that turned its email program around to drive significant revenue growth. Here's how they did it:
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Despite having flows and campaigns in place, the results were not in line with Oceanus's potential. Their email program had low engagement and was contributing less than 10% of their total revenue.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Strategy</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              We didn't start from scratch but audited and rebuilt the existing email setup focusing on three main pillars:
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Smart Segmentation</strong>: Rebuilt the list into live segments based on real behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Flow Infrastructure That Actually Converts</strong>: Mapped out the entire customer journey with a focus on personalized branching.</li>
                <li><strong>Campaign Rhythm + Retention Intent</strong>: Transitioned from generic email drops to a retention-first campaign calendar.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Results</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              After 45 days of executing the new strategy, Oceanus saw a significant improvement:
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>Email revenue contribution increased to 30% of total revenue.</li>
                <li>Return customer rate increased by 111%, from 9% to 19.72%.</li>
                <li>AOV (Average Order Value) increased by 19% to â‚¬352.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why This Worked</h3>
            <p>
              The success wasn't due to more emails or new technology. It was due to a retention system built on customer behavior, focused on repeat purchases and maximizing customer lifetime value (LTV).
